# Vue 3 Realword app with Server Side Sendering (SSR)

> :shit: coded version of [original repo](https://github.com/mutoe/vue3-realworld-example-app) with working SSR, made with :heart:

This is an experiment with a try to make _normal_ (at least working) SSR. Don't perceive the code as production-ready.  
If you know how to make things better, PRs are welcome

## Getting started

git clone https://github.com/levchak0910/vue3-ssr-realworld-example-app.git
cd vue3-ssr-realworld-example-app
yarn install
yarn build-production
yarn serve-production
```

### For development
```shell script
yarn build
yarn serve
```
